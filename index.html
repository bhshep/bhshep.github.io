<img src="180.png" />
<p>Calculate the price as fast as the auctioneer can call.</p>
</body>
<p>This app is for use at Live Stock Auctions by both sellers and buyers.  Start by entering the weight of the animal that is being presented for auction.  Scroll the picker wheel to what you think the animal is worth.  As you are scrolling, the calculator is constantly calculating the price per Kg.  Alternatively you can scroll the price with the auctioneer and have the price per Kg calculated "live".</p>
<p>If you like, you can estimate a dressing percentage for the animal on offer and the calculator will calculate a dressed price as well.</p>
<p>If you are the seller and you are happy with the price offered then you can press the Sell button.  You then add a few more details regarding the transaction and a record of that transaction is saved.</p>
<p>If you are the buyer and you successfully make a purchase then press the Buy button, add some more information and save the transaction.</p>
<p>All transactions at a particular sale are saved under that sale name and date.</p>
<p>Specific information regarding individual transactions can be edited and changed if need be.</p>
